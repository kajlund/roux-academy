# Building a website with Node.js and Express

This repository contains the code for the course 'Building a Website with Node.js and Express' on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-a-website-with-node-js-and-express-js-3).

Since I know express far beyound the course material I decided to follow the course and build the  sample using the Fastify web framework instead of Express.

## Setting up the project

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
